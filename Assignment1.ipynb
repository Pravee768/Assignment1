    "Question(1): In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* \n",
    "'hello'\n",
    "-87.8\n",
    "- \n",
    "/ \n",
    "+\t\n",
    "6 \n",
    "Solution: In the above question, Values and extressions are as follow\n",
    "Values :'hello' , -87.8 , 6\n",
    "Expression: * , - , / , + \n",
    "\n",
    "Question(2): What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Solution: There are following differecnces between string and variabls\n",
    "\n",
    "Variabls: Variables are symbols that could be use to hold the different types of data like integers, flote, string etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "String: A string is a sequence of one or more characters that can either a constant and variable. String is a one type of fundamental data type, which is use in Python programing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question(3): Describe three different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Three different data types in Python are:\n",
    "Int, float and complex\n",
    "\n",
    "int(integers data type like 1, 3 etc): They are positive or negative whole numbers with no decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "float(float data type like 10.23, 3.89 etc): float values are specified with a decimal point.\n",
    "\n",
    "complex(complet data type like 4 + 10j): Complex data type could be represented by a + bj where a is real part and b is imaginery part. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question(4): What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Expression is a combination of variables, operations and values that yields a result value.\n",
    "Expressions are representations of value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question(5): This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Any Instruction that a python interpreter can execute (carry out) is called a Statement. Statements represent an action or command e.g print statements, assignment statements. Expression is a combination of variables, operations and values that yields a result value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question(6): After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: \n",
    "After running above code, result: bacon = 23\n",
    "\n",
    "Question(7): What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam'\n",
    "'spam' * 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: \n",
    "Output of 'spam' + 'spamspam' is 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "Output of 'spam' * 3 is 'spamspamspam'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Question(8): Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Solution: \n",
    "Variable name should not start wirh digits, so eggs is a valid variable and 100 is not a valid variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Question(9): What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Solution: \n",
    "The int() , float() , and str( ) functions will evaluate to the integer, floating-point number, and string versions of the value passed to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question(10): Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: in the above expression 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos ' 'I have eaten ' is a string and ' burritos ' is also a string but 99 is an integer. so it will through error. if i change 99 as '99' then it will not through an error. concatenate will happen only str to str. \n",
